# timezone-converter-project
Works with timezone codes and inputted time to generate the converted time in the new timezone.

This is my first project!

It is based upon the following API: https://timezonedb.com/references/convert-time-zone

I use Vanilla JS (Fetch API, Promise Chaining, Date object) to manipulate the data requested to convert the user's timezone depending on what is entered in the inputs

I aim to improve the user experience, and to add a few new features in time:

- Auto-generate function in timezone input
- Ability to search by location
- General UI optimisations

As of 7/5/21 I intend to refactor the code and perform general optimisations

Thank you for your attention!
